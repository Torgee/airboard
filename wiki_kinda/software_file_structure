Software File Structure:

This is about the file structure for the software components, e.g. where C++ and python programs and libraries will go.
This section in seperated in two major parts: pre- and post-build.
pre-build part is about where sources(.h,.cpp.py), makefiles and eventually ressources go. post-build part is about where tools, driver, config-files etc go.


Pre Build:

file-tree idea:
(d: directory, f: file, []*: multiple entities)

d software
  - d src # source for c++ (both .cpp and .h)
     - d shared # folder for all shared sources, e.g. algorithms and stuff
        - d* modules # folder for module components
     - d apps # forder for all applications, e.g. visualization,config-tools
        - d* app-folder # most probably one folder for each app
  - d py # python files
     - d scripts # contains all scripts, e.g. for running a simulation
     - d tests # well, for tests ...
     - d airboard # for main python stuff, in form of a package
        - f __init__.py
        - f* *.py # optional 1-file modules, who don't need a sub-directory
        - d* modules/packages # sub-directory within the package structure

Post-Build:
