Interest:
of particular interest is the implementation of trajectory simulation, as well as the visualization which uses both matplotlib as well as mayavi (thus vtk).
If the suite itself is usable depends on the ability to generate/access life data, even though on could still save the IMUSime generated data and then reread them to feed a life system.
