ToDo

ordered list (incomplete!)

 - (done) setup git as 
 - (done) setup bugs everywhere as distributed issue manager
*** the following is about single 6DOf IMU sensor, other sensors/data
     should work simultainously (care for concurrency, tho!!!) ***
 - evaluate data-management solutions
 - look more inut 'imusim' and see if that can be used or if there are
   critical limitations
 - generate appropriate data to simulate movements of a 6DOF imu as follows:
    1 exact data for positions with high sampling rate
    2 blurred (gauss?) version of the above, eventually as on-the-fly option
   Note: generate at least some movements as a close-loop, to be able to run
         them indefinitely
 - elaborate means to access the offline data in a way that allows to switch to
   real measurements easily
    - access to data should be possible to either timing dependant (time goes
      by even when not polling the data), or independant, for debugging
   Note: this topic may be switched with data visualization (or at least a
         primitive version thereoff)
 - data visualization (hopefully using the aforementioned way of access)
    - offline and online visualization!
 - ...


unordere list (incomplete!)

 - create an icon!
    - svg as template, to derive icon from?
 - a nice addon would be to have the possibility to have an interactive visualization of
   the current IMU position which allows to move the imu virtually through mouse/keybord (or other) input. This could be useful to have a more immersive way to test the effects of imu input
 - use github to push the git repo to
 - use gitit as git-based wiki (and migrate this file!)
