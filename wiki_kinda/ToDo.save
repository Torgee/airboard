ToDo:

ordered list (incomplete!):

 - (done) setup git for version control
 - (done) setup bugs everywhere for distributed issue managment
 - setup gitit as git-based (thus distributed) wiki
*** the following topics are the first steps that will only concider a single sensor
  for 6DOF inert movement/position - other input data, such as joint-angles
  or raw distances for triangulation should be able to be handled simultainously
  
 - evaluate data-management solutions
    - especially some that fits for simulated IMU-data
 - try implement the above and generate some appropriate sample data
   needed data will be:
    - simulated high precision exact movements
       - should ideally contain closed-loop movements, that can be run
         indefinitely
    - subsampled/blurred versions of the above, or means to generate such
      noise on-the-fly from the exact data
   data also needs timestamps!
 - elaborate means to provide/read that data through an interface that simulates
   the way a real IMU would work, e.g.:
    - be realtime-consistent (to simulate the real sampling), i.e. the data
      will continue in time even when not polled
    - timing inconsisten version may also be needed (especially for debugging)
   (this topic may be switched up with data visualiyation, though using this
   way for providing data for visualization is a strong plus!)
 - visualization of the data (hopefully accesing data through the
   aforementioned ways)
 - start on implementing
